                        <p><u>Description</u></p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        Founded in 1994, the Ateneo Management Information Systems Association is now on it 25th year in pursuing its main advocacy – social transformation through information management. Through the organization’s continuous efforts, we strive to carry on this advocacy through the next generations who will inform, form, and to transform the society.
                       </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        Unfortunately, due to the unforeseen circumstances that have put a halt to many activities all over the world, events such as our very own MISA Year End Party that would have been held today was also cancelled. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        For many, this event would have been their first or last project of the year. It was an event meant to celebrate the end of the semester, bond together with fellow orgmates, welcome the turnover of the new Executive Board, and say our farewell to the graduating seniors. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        In light of this, as there would be no YEP this year to close off the semester we have come up with another medium not only to end the year but also to celebrate a milestone for the organization and recount its last 25 years of service in 125 seconds. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        This has been the 25th MISA Board of Executives and the Associates, and together, let us continue to build tomorrow through business technology.

                        <u>Videographer's Note</u>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        As the last project for the academic year, I wanted to properly end my term with a promotion that would commemorate and encapsulate not only the BETA 1920 signing off but also the closing of the 25th year anniversary of the organization. Given as well that the year was cut short due to the suspensions caused by the pandemic, it would be best to use the digital medium as well to still let the organization’s presence be known through projects or promotions. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        My main concept of the video was simply to showcase the 25 years that the organization has gone through in a <i>short </i>video that the members would easily watch when they see it online. Thinking of how 25 would be an essential number for the post plus emphathizing to an user's tendency to skip over long videos, I decided to slap on having the video in only 125 seconds (approx. 2 minutes).
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                         For pre-production, the difficulty was simply to gather all the footages from the past years. There weren’t much as most documentations were photos, therefore, the earliest video I could find dated 2009. Despite this limitation, I proceeded with my plan to show the 2009-2020 clips of Ateneo MISA. I disregarded the need to create a storyboard, and simply gathered the necessary resources (all footages I could find and the main background audio), since I didn't want any voiceover so that the videos would simply speak for itself of the years that has gone by for the organization.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        My editing style for this video became sort of impromptus despite the original plan being based on a skeletal flow of the video was from the earliest to the latest date of MISA videos sort-of like a timeline through the years. Having the limitation of videos dating only from 2009 (and not really 1994), I didn't feel that the timeline montage would matter, thus I eventually relied on the audio I could find from the videos I have, which mainly focused the <b>people</b> of MISA. Now, what I really just wanted to to show was <b>who we were in the span of 25 years</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        I made the central design style of the video as a vintage-tape kind of feel in order to give a nostalgic feeling for the audience by adding film textures, mellow electronic music, vintage computer sounds, filtered narrations, and vhs-like video colorings. This video was for the members in the past, the members that are about to leave, the members that are left behind, and the future members of MISA. This is to show Ateneo MISA, <b>so far</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        For the celebration of the 90 years of the publication, The GUIDON wanted to release an interactive article regarding their slow transition towards an online one in the coming year. I was then tasked to design the interactive without any prior website pegs given, and simply just the article at hand with a few suggested animations of their liking.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        With that, I had to research on possible pegs for the Interactive. What I suddenly remembered was people reacting to the Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/">Macbook</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/ph/iphone-11-pro/">iPhone 11 Pro</a> websites before. A lot of users were astonished by how the product was presented with the use of a simple scroll function to go through the website. Therefore, I decided to present the article the same way. (Note: Some desired transitions that were supposed to mimic the ones from the Apple websites <i>like the laptop zooming out or the search bar sticking to the top of the laptop </i> weren't reflected in the final website, but seen in the Figma prototype, due to development limitations. However, the final transitions done were still approved and checked upon with my developer counterpart.)
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        I simply used the default The GUIDON Typeface in their usual articles as well as the official The GUIDON palettes. Gradients of The GUIDON colors were used in order for the colors to not be together with touches of red-orange-violet shades as an adjustment made to a feedback regarding the colors used initially to be plain and limited.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        To start off the interactive, I wanted the reader to immediately understand what the following article would be about. I made an expanding search bar animation to present the title, which immediately transitions to the laptop illustration to encapsulate the main idea of The GUIDON Online. This follows through with the rest of the article with graphics such as the phone graphic, vectorized illustrations, and other The GUIDON images used. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        In order for it to be a succesful interactive, I must then find a way for the user to simply <b>not </b>just feel they are reading a plain article full of just <i> words </i>. Aside from the animated transitions done throughout the article through scrolling, for the pros and cons section, which was just presented in the plain text as a table, I decided to separate each point to not only give emphasis but to also enable more scroll interaction between the website and the user.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        To further add to the engagement of the users, instead of the static visual graphic suggested by the writers for the quotes for the future application, I presented these in a way that the users are able to voluntarily click on the features of the layout in order to see the quote (as seen below). This does not only add to the user's interactive experience while reading the article, but it also gives emphasis and importance to what is in store for the publication. By highlighting this interactive in the article, a user is able to have a <i> taste </i> of what Guidon plans for its app in the future.

                         <p style="text-align:justify">
                        For this work, the client simply sent me a copy of their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WeAreLeads/videos/288214318722174/?v=288214318722174">old travel video</a> as a general peg and a harddrive containing all their raw footages from South Korea. The instructions from the client were simple and clear: "I have this bunch of raw vids and i just need someone to edit them into a <b>decent </b>travel vid." So, with that I wanted to make a travel video that showed the company's incentive and how they were able to make the people during the whole trip.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        To start, I researched for a Korean song that was simple short but with a happy chill vibe to it. I wanted the footages to be accompanied with a feel-good song that makes one enjoy, yet at the same time a song that wasn't too long or too unfamiliar sounding for the general mass. I viewed the many <i> many </i> videos I was given and selected a few that would be perfect to put in the 2 minute video. I started with a scene which was the travelers in their natural state during the trip: talking about the very very very cold weather yet at the same time enthusiastically grateful for the experience given by the company. It was an appropriate start to a video that showcased the trip they had experienced. Then comes the intro of the landscapes with a zoom in transitions, the clips of the food, and all of the adventures they did during the trip. I also found a clip testimonial to show right before the video ends, to effectively show the trip was effective and full of joy. After a few more effects and transitions, the video ends with the group cheering for the company in multiple locations. It ends by leaving the viewer the thought of how the South Korea trip wouldn't be experienced by the group if it weren't for the opportunity given by the company.

                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        This annual project by the Communication Cluster was made to present the board of the executives and the associates for that academic year. It was the main medium for the people behind the organization to be known and recognized by the members. With that, I wanted to the members to see who we are through various promotions.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        For this year, like what I started last year as an AVP, I planned to create videos for the clusters, profile photos for each officer, an album showing all of BETA, and additional new teaser to start up the project. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        My AVPs and I gathered pegs already for the <a href="https://imgur.com/r/exo/f8gee">photoshoot</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwugc-DRbSok">videos</a> to be done. We aspired to highlight the <b>brand of the organization</b> (especially following its <i>rebranding</i>) through our colors and business tech image, but at the same time show to the members a <b>personal side </b>of each member of BETA.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        For the photoshoot, we went for a curtain like setup for the photoshoot with the use of the teal color with an accompanying blue color. The use of the stool, chair, and couch against the cloth background was to have a minimalistic feel to the photo as well as to highlight the BETA officer itself without any additional component in the shot. The props were also all dark grey as one of MISA's primary colors as well as highlighting it against the light cloth in the background. A while cloth is casually or messily placed at the bottom of the seats for added texture and color in the photos.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        This simple setup were highlighted in most of the promos through the behind-the-scenes style. The backdrop of the setup itself were also used in the teaser graphic and for the Instagram filler covers. To further give emphasis on the overall simplicity of the theme style, in the spiel, Simply BETA, Simply MISA were used as well.

                        Each member were also to wear anything white that is smart-casual, to show the image of formality and refinement but at the same relaxed, as what the org should be. Every person was also given the choice to select the particular prop they want to use: stool, chair, or even the couch (although this was only done for the president).

                        For the group  photos, my AVPs and I decided to have both formal and casual shots. The casual shots contain props that would help someone looking at the photo understand what they do in that particular cluster. The layout of the photos are placed against a white background with the text underneath for simplicity and elegance.

                        Next up are the videos! There were 4 videos in total with two offices/clusters per video. Each video focuses on a central theme in order to learn something about the members of those clusters. The topics of the videos focused on their goals, favorites, wishes, and memories (Stylized as <i>“My Goals" </i>) The output to be done is similar to this peg which lets the person answer the question in short answers in a sit down shot, while at the same time showing footages of the behind-the-scenes of the photoshoot once again.

                      <p style="text-align:justify">
                          After having the DesignCon with the writers, developer, graphic artist, and their executive counter parts regarding the interactive, the general description of the article to be made was having to show those who still have to work during Christmas amidst the national holiday. The team wanted to have an interactive that will show the Christmas spirit but at the same time highlight the stories of those to be interviewed. They (the writers) shared their ideas for design presentation such as a Christmas tree with colored Christmas balls relating to their work colors or the ornaments being the actual job that they do (like a car for the transportation service) with a side popup to be showed when hovered or even a redirect to a new page, and other suggestions. After that meeting, it was still up to me on how the Interactive will be presented. Thus, considering their suggestions, the purpose of the website, which is to show the life of the workers, and the appropriate interface for the user, I ended up with a general profile for the interactive, together with the rough sketch made by my graphic artist partner.
                      </p> <br>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                         It is a normal Christmas setup, showing its spirit and vibe through warm colors. However, in the tree would be outshining Christmas Balls, that if clicked, will overlay the actual articles. For the ornament design, I came up with the combination of the two suggestions by simply putting the <i> worlds </i> of the worker inside the Christmas Ball, and when clicked, it will allow the user to experience their "worlds" by entering them in order to realize the reality of how the holiday is for the workers.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        For the user to easily understand the website, we decided to add instructions at the bottom of the page so that they know that they are supposed to scroll and click on the ornaments.
                    </p> <br>
                     <img src="img2/xmas4.png" width=100%>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        What I also did was to add this hover option, wherein the names and jobs of the interviewed will be placed. It also adds to better user experience as they would know what the ornament drawing is trying to portray and at the same time they have already a short <i> entrance </i> to what they will be reading. I made it into a christmas present tag that highlights against the dark opacity background. The fact that the user has to voluntarily click on the ornaments to view the stories, also adds to the interaction between the user and the website, aside from them just reading an article.

                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        With that, the interactive was able to present the <b>real life elves of Santa </b>also known as these hardworking Filipinos interviewed (and the rest of the people who work tirelessy each day despite the holidays), and through this well-deserved their recognition, we are able to celebrate the true spirit of Christmas by letting <b>their stories be heard</b>.

                        <p>Implemented, and officially announced on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ateneo.MISA/videos/714861259036322/">Facebook</a> </p>
                        <p><u>Description:</u></p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        For the 25th year of the organization, the logo and overall branding of Ateneo MISA was revamped to effectively promote the org by forming a brand image that is more modern and appropriate for the current society to properly advocate the orgs values and core competency: social transformation through information management.
                       </p>
                        <br />
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        <u>Designer/Videographer's Note:</u>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        As the Vice President of Communications 2019-2020, what I have noticed is that the organization’s logo seems outdated and inconsistent with the branding that the organization is trying to portray. I wanted to make sure that I will be able to slowly incorporate the needed changes for the image of the org during my term. It was also just right that it was the 25th year of the organization, thus, celebrating the milestone of the org with the rebranding done. 
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        To properly accomplish the rebranding, I evaluated what the organization currently has as image. There were three main aspects of MISA’s brand: teal, hexagons, and the robot mascot (MISA Bot). To start, prior my term as both AVP then VP, the latter has already been changed into a friendly vector illustration of the mascot, therefore, there was no changes to be done with that, but instead there was then a need to make the logo fitting with this earlier change of mascot style as well as a clearer definition of the organization's brand. What I focused then was the two former elements mentioned, since these two were the symbols that you will instantly remember when you hear the name of the organization, thus I did not want to stray away from that strong and stable figure association already made in the 25 years of MISA. The current logo had a rugged text of the words MISA, with the long title at the bottom, and outlined hexagon logo that come in teal, black, and white. The logo is fitting to the old mascot of the organization, I must say, but it does look outdated and too <i> technical </i> because of the choice of font. Also, the outlined hexagons and the single dark hues of the colors used made the image of the organization dull and sluggish to what MISA actually is.
                        <br>

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        With that, what I wanted for the rebranding was it to:
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        1) Maintain the curent brand recall of the organization
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        2) Showcasing the values and identity of the organization
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        3) Have a more modern and friendlier interconnected image
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        To address the first and second reasons, I started with the things that I <b>didn't </b>want to change, the teal and hexagons. I did not want to change the three hexagons because of how MISA has already created a big brand out of these three and also how it stood for the three core values of the organization: Excellence, Servant Leadership, and Professionalism. Also, as the home org of MIS majors, I still wanted to higlight the origin of it all, our course, MIS.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        Proceeding still with the second one and introducing the third reason, as the organization is both focused on Business and Techology, there is then a need to change the font of the logo as it seems to <i> technical </i> to the eyes as it has rugged edges. The change of the text to Montserrat, an elegant smooth font, would not only be pleasing to look at as it is more modernized and well-desigbed web font, but it allows one to see the org's business technology side. It is also noted how the current logo's hexagons had sharp edges, it is part of UI design that rounded edges are "easier on the eyes than a rectangle with sharp edges because they take less cognitive effort to visually process," (<a href="https://medium.com/@carolinalina/how-to-design-ui-buttons-that-convert-d5ebb1080969">Article</a>) with this taken into account, as a designer and given that MISA also does Web Development Services <i>thus advocating proper UX/UI as well</i>, I made the hexagons have rounded edges to appear friendlier to the viewer and also to show how the organization has this united attitude to its members as well, amidst its formality in nature. 
                        </p>
                        <br><img src="img2/rb2.png" width=100%>

                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        The Communications VP for 2018-2019 or the one before me, also expressed before how dark the teal used in our logo (or brand) is. Remembering this and wanting to make the new brand more modern and friendlier as stated in the third reason, I made the teal a bit brighter and also in gradient. Not only has it been a trend recently, but the comibination of the two to three shades of teal gives life to the brand of the organization. As gradients allow the image to be "memorable, unique, realistic, and colorful" (<a href="https://medium.muz.li/why-gradients-are-the-new-colors-3d8d42a7a6fc9">Article</a>), it allows the viewer to see the image of the org with more depth. The change in logo in general also makes the current mascot (which. as mentioned above, has been revamped already) be more fitting and connected with each other. It helps a member of the org understand what the org is trying to portay: <b> a business technology organization that is firm to its advocacies yet a family to its members. </b>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        From these identified factors above as well as having constant consultation with my Associate Vice Presidents and fellow Executive Board members, I ended up with the following rebranding.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        The logo comes with three variations the wide primary, medium tall, and small icon in teal, dark grey, and white. Plus, an additional one color small icon logo and a default image logo for profile photos. I decied to have versions of the logo so that it can elevate the organization's brand more through having options that can be used depending on the type of medium it will be placed on. For this year's rebranding, the organization also released its t-shirt merchandise for its 25th year featuring the new logo.

                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        Through the use of the rounded hexagons, gradient teal, and a sans-serif typeface, the rebranding was able to <b> transform a flat, outdated, stiff, and a too ‘technical-like’ kind of design into a modern friendly elegant with color dimension </b> that is still familiar and ideal for a business technology organzation made for society transformation.

                        </p>
                        <p>For this project, I designed the UI based on the previous one, since that was what the client wanted, but with revisions that would make the system more user-friendly for both the main users of the platform: <b>the students and the administrations</b>. <i>It is also to be noted that not the final prototyped design may have been altered based on the comments of the client as well as the developers' limitations.</i></p>

                        <p>I mainly took upon the personas of the two users that will be using the system mentioned above. The main purpose of the system was to open the room, simple as that. Therefore, the landing page is simply that, wherein the student can simply scan/input their ID for it to open, thus I highlighted that in the landing page compared to before that it a small part of it. I made sure that most of the page is filled with clear buttons and instructions so that the student will easily know what to do.</p>

                        <p>Given that there are a number of organization listed, I made the interace to divide these per element more distinguishable. To add, the check and cross buttons would add more of a visual element to the admin to easier approve or decline the rooms to be opened. </p>

                       Every day our actions are influenced by our upbringing, media, and most importantly, culture. Though distinct in lifestyle, Koreans and Filipinos are connected by the whole experience of living or being a person. As students, learning about each other's lifestyles serve as an aid to the connection we have with one another. We learn to understand and show appreciation for the kind of culture each grew up to live in. Learning opens the window between two cultures, allowing us to bond. Through time, it becomes easier to see that there is beauty that resides on both sides of the window.

                       <u>Videographer's Note</u>
                        </p>
                        <p>When I first learned about the theme, which focuses on the celebration of friendship between Korea and the Philippines, from then on I wanted to show how despite the differences in culture, there is still unity and connection between the two. </p>

                        <p>Working on the screenplay, I remember seeing this <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shinliart/">account</a> showing a couple from United States and Korea comparing how they perform their routine daily. It reflects how there is truly a huge difference between the way they perform their tasks, but there still that similarity of the fact that they are simply just two individuals going through each day. With that, I wanted to present my video the same way: <b>two different perspectives of life one inspired by the Korean culture and another simply living the Filipino culture.</b></p>

                        <p>Together with the two points of view peg, given that we are both in college, I also decided to do the routine based on how we are as students in the university. The video goes through our normal school day, with I, as the one focusing on the Philippine Culture, while my partner <i> who is really a Korean Pop fan </i> reflected the Korean Culture. The video starts from the moment we wake up until the day ends, with us celebrating our friendship during our Korean Language Class, where we help each other and simply enjoy each other's company. Working on the script, I wanted to further exemplify the two varying cultures, by using those two languages only throughout the video.</p>


                        <p>Ultimately, the video is able to show the diversity yet its unity in the process. It makes the viewer realize that language and personal preferences does <i>not</i> hinder friendship. It makes you realize that <b>we aren't so different after all.</b></p>

                        <p><u>Description</u></p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        For the Ateneo de Manila University organizations' Recruitment Week 2019: Orbit, the Ateneo MISA released a series of promotional materials to entice college students to join the organization for the academic year. This Recweek theme is focused on the concept of space.
                       </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        <u>Designer's Note</u>
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to properly introduce the organization, I wanted to make use what already is known to the org, our mascot. Thus, I maximized the designs through the application of the spatial theme with our very own MISA Bot and the slogan that encapsulates our tech aspect through the generic computer program message of 'Hello World' as part of the slogan. This then suggests a <b>friendly overall image</b> in order to further entice people to join the organization.</p>

                        <p>Aside from the kind and bright design presented, in order to recruit members, the people should also know more about who we are as an organization. In order to do these, I made two main posters that presents one with visual information of what the MIS is and another with the text information of all the things that MISA does. This is presented through the poster showing all the MIS-related objects with a desktop leading into the world to be explored with MISA, and another poster that lists down all services, initiatives, and advocacies done as an organization. </p>

                        <p>As my first project as the Vice President for Communications, I wanted to incorporate interaction engagement more with the users and viewers when posting promotional materials. With that in mind, I decided to create this first interactive poster, wherein the students (even the alumni) can react to what they feel about the course. This would not only promote engagement for the posts but it also would let the user experience<i> more </i>with the pub materials and not just view them. For the rest of the promos done, I simply applied the space theme with our branding in order to encourage people to join. </p>

                        As an UX/UI Design Intern in GroupM, this was one of the prototypes assigned for us to do. In the creation of this study, there is the lingering risk and uncertainty as it is a new application to be introduced by the client to the public causing the application to be designed from scratch. To deal with this challenge, a competitive audit, research, and brand analysis, were made accomplished as discussed in the rationale below:
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">

                        <p> <center> Some Pages from the Competitive Review Deck </center></p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        For this specific design, the Airbnb and Globe Rewards applications were used as a guide for its layout and content. These two were respectively regarded as basis given that: First, Airbnb has an interface that is not only aesthetically simple and pleasing for the users but it is also of ease to use for most individuals in the millennial community, which is the target market presented in the quantum deck. Second, the Globe Rewards is an existing application that has a similar goal to the requested app, which is to showcase rewards and promos to its subscribers. The prototype was then matched to the standards of this specific app that has the same end goal to ensure value for its future users.

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        The gold and dark grey color scheme of the prototype illustrates a sophisticated and elegant appearance in order to cater to the application’s elite target market. The thin and regular fonts of Helvetica Neue were used all throughout the prototype to maintain the elegance of the interface.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        The prototype includes a bottom navigation bar to establish an easy navigation of pages throughout the use of the app. The layout of the perks and rewards in the app were organized in a way that it would make the user feel that each of it is worthy of a great deal. These are divided into <b>navigation items </b>wherein the user is able to: 
                        <p>1) Explore perks and rewards near its location </p>
                        <p>2) Discover perks and rewards based on the user’s preference and history</p>
                        <p>3) Search promos and rewards in their own time. </p> 

                        <p>These aspects were considered to cater the user’s experience during the app. It is evident in applications like Airbnb, Zomato, etc. that users are able to conveniently look for a value based on their location, choices, or feelings. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        In the search function, the user will be able to filter out the expected results by the latest to the oldest and vice versa, by the most expensive to the least and vice versa, and by category. It is also to be noted how the perks are presented first than the rewards to gratify the use of the application as these promos are exclusively for the subscriber with no transaction needed. For each perk and reward selected, the user is able to redeem the selected item, save it into his/her calendar for future use or gift it to someone else. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                        A noted addition to the prototype is the aspect that exceeds usual mobile application interaction, which is gamification. The middle and most noticeable button found in the navigation bar is the infinity sign logo of the program. Once the button is triggered, it brings out the screen of a slot machine. The user is then able to use this simple game once a day wherein they have the chance to be able to win special rewards. This feature was made to entice the users to use the application on a daily basis. A slot machine game was chosen since the use of casinos and the like, match the gold and dark vibe of the application seemingly pertaining to popular contemporary luxurious themes like Luhrmann’s 2013 film of the <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/vickiegonzales/great-gatsby-party/">“The Great Gatsby.”</a> This activity is also often associated as that of a high class activity as it is always located in fancy hotels, restaurants, retail shopping, cruise ships or other tourist attractions, thus fitting for the overall target of the application.

                        Other features of the proposed application includes a hamburger menu which shows to the user’s profile details as well as links to other necessary components of the application. A chat bot is also part of the prototype, as requested by the client, in a familiar layout similar to that of any chatting applications. In addition to this bot is the option to directly contact someone from the Concierge. The Infinity Badge was also translated into a QR code, since this is the most efficient and modern way to scan or access your account in any store. For easy access, users are simply to login through the biometrics feature to enter the application. However, a login page using a password is also included in the application.

                        <p>Given that the website is mainly focused on one purpose, I was able to effectively disseminate the information needed for the user through the layout and design constructed. The inclusion of the outage map and safety tips checklist now become the call to actions of the users upon access. However the website’s simplicity also appeared as a limitation as there was no other function or feature that can be added that will be deemed necessary. Therefore, the prototype study mainly focuses on the actual purpose of the website for a user who wants to know any of the important updates regarding an emergency’s situation: <b>what happened, what is being done by Meralco, and what do we do.</b></p>
                        <p> Aside from being able to view the Outage Map, I made sure to add the related articles linking to other news websites since as a resident under an emergency, it is most likely that the user woud like to know more about the situation. This adds to a better experience of the user when the website is up and running. Additionally, to add user interaction, for the safety tips, it is presented as some sort of checklist that the users can check when understood, done, or practiced. </p>

                        Blue, yellow, and red. Everyone knows these as the primary sources of any color combination that we see in our everyday lives. The three colors bring out the brightness, calmness, and most importantly the beauty of life’s varied shades and hues. I focused on these colors and made them the central theme of the video. Featuring the wondrous streets and sceneries of both South Korea and the Philippines, the video is an observation of how both nations incorporate blues, yellows, and reds into their cultures. It is through these that we can see how, despite the existence of uniqueness, there is a strong connection in their similarities. Unity arises not only through the vibrant primary colors but also the parallelisms of both countries, wherein the Korean influence is now heavily integrated in the lives of Filipinos. Blue, yellow and red also signify the countries’ political identities, appearing in the Philippine flag and Korea’s tricolored 태극기 (taegeukgi).

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> For my video piece in this contest, I felt the need to show the how the current relationship of my country, the Philippines, is with South Korea through the most vibrant way possible: <b> the use of colors.</b> I focused on the three primary colors, red, blue, and yellow, because of how these three make up <i>all</i>the other colors that we see. (And additionally, a bonus meaning, the three colors are commonly significant in both traditions as mentioned in the description above.)</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                        Given this concept, I was then able to apply how the Korean culture has greatly impacted our own by adding more shades of these colors into what we experience, making it livelier and more beautiful. But, our own culture still shines through beside that of the Korean nation. We also see through these colors the likeness we have as nations, that despite our differences, there is still the connection seen in the two cultures through the <i>spectrum </i>that we both see in our daily lives. The three colors make up each country individually, but together, the cultures are able to complement each other by providing different yet familiar shades and hues for one to experience.</p>

                        The annual MISA initiative for the members known as MISA Balls or Sportsfest will finally be happening soon! For this year, it will feature games against the different batches for Volleyball and Basketball. MISA Sportsfest 2018, or popularily known as MISA Balls, is presented through the following promotions in order to entice the members to join and watch the fest.

                        In the past years, the organization's sportsfest had not pushed through or there weren't any posters for it made. This year, I wanted to change that and let the initiative be recognized more for the MISA members. With that, I decided to make a total of four posters for this year's sportsfest: the main poster, the volleyball poster, the basketball poster, and the awards poster.</p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                       For my posters, I presented the sports following the peg of <i> sports court minimalist photography </i> and through the use of the simple colors, which stood for the different batches participating. </p>

                        Featuring the wondrous streets, people, food, and undoubtedly the colorful culture of South Korea, the video revolves around our experience during the summer in the Land of the Morning Calm last June to July for our Summer Term Abroad in Seoul National University. At present, we look back at all the memories gained from our month long stay, and dwell on these as we have returned to the Philippines. As all of these experiences remain etched in our minds, through the act of reminiscing, we are then led to the enlightenment of not only the differences between the two countries but also how the Korean culture has made a huge impact to our own home country. South Korea had clearly awed us of its development and discipline, but more importantly, it is because of the people we were with and all the places we went to that the country and the entirety of the summer abroad duration felt and became like home.

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> For my video piece in this contest, I centered it around me and my partner's own personal experiences in the country of Korea as both Filipinos, perfectly encapsulating <b>seeing Korea in our own eyes</b>. Through a rereminiscence, my partner and I tell our own stories through the video. This shows our own trip to South Korea during our Summer Term Abroad in Seoul University for a month as both foreign students there, with the addition of my own past experiences in Korea as a tourist.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify"> The video starts a short lyric narration as an introduction to our memories to be presented. As the series of raw footages of our trip are played to show the beauty and uniqueness of it all, our narration simply runs through the whole video, alternately between me and my partner. This then switches to us at present in the Philippines after the trip, indicating how much Korea has influenced us, but also how their culture is actually quite present in our own country as well. The video ends with a quick montage of our own clips back to our term abroad, to present how much we enjoyed during the whole experience to reminisce it all.</p>

                        <p>After being briefed about the citrus-summer palette theme as well as discussing the elements to be used with my fellow designers, I figured that the logo and posters with simply feature the festive colors with illustrations that would portray the message to the viewer once they see the poster. I decided that the general peg matched with the font that would be handwritten, given that the party will be also just for the members of the organization, thus a personal visual style would go well with the summer party vibes of the event.</p>
